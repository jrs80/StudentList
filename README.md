# StudentList

This project simulates a university registar's database.  The user can add students to the database and then view the list of students.  
It is created using a factory-pattern model with a C# interface (Student) that is implemented by several other classes (e.g. Undergraduate).
The user interface is console-based, which gives it a nice old-school (see what I did there?) vibe.
